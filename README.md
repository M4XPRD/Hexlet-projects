## What is this all about?
<a name="bg-desc"></a>

Â«Brain gamesÂ» is a set of 5 different games which are similar to popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. 

The game is finished, if you answer correctly three times in a row. If the answer is wrong the game stops, and you'll have a message asking to try to play again once more. The list of games:


**â€¢ Calculator.** It's about arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.

**â€¢ Progression.** It's about finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.

**â€¢ Determining an even number.**

**â€¢ Determining the greatest common divisor.**

**â€¢ Determining a prime number.**

## Installation

## Description:
<a name="dc-desc"></a>

This is the utility, which shows the difference between two files. The output can be shown with different formats.
<br></br>
**List of supported extensions:**

â€¢ JSON (```.json``` file extension)

â€¢ YML/YAML (```.yml```or ```.yaml``` file extensions)
<br></br>
**List of output formats:**

â€¢ ```stylish``` is standart format, which will show the difference between files with ```+``` and ```-``` signs.

â€¢ ```plain``` is human-readable variant, where you can see the string-like output of each line, that has any changes. 

â€¢ ```json``` is variant, which is similar to *stylish*. But instead of ```+``` and ```-``` you will see AST-tree-like system with statuses of *keys* and their *types*.

## Installation:
<a name="dc-inst"></a>

```sh

# Step 1 â€” clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/M4XPRD/frontend-project-lvl2

# Step 2 â€” install the dependencies

**Important note** â€” in order to use this utility correctly, you should move to ***__fixtures__*** folder in terminal, where you can upload and use your files. 

```sh
# Help window
gendiff -h

# All commands below should run from __fixtures__ folder!

# Show difference with standart (stylish) format
gendiff file1.json file2.json

# Show difference with stylish format
gendiff --format stylish file1.json file2.json

# Show difference with plain format
gendiff --format plain file1.json file2.json

# Show difference with json format
gendiff --format json file1.json file2.json
```
